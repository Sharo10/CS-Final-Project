The game mechanics are well-implemented and the objects are properly classed for efficient state management. I particularly like the way you have defined the enemies and the spacecraft with their respective properties and behaviors. The pause and resume functionality is robust and the state-saving approach is intuitive and effective. Also, I admire the way you've made the game progressively harder by increasing the enemy speed. On the other hand, I noticed that the hitbox for the spacecraft is generous. Perhaps this is intentional for game balance, but it might be worth adjusting to make the game more challenging. Lastly, consider breaking down the larger functions into smaller ones for better maintainability and readability of the code.

I loved the graphics! The spacecraft and enemies look cool. I felt the game got more difficult the longer I played, which was fun and kept me engaged. The coins were a nice touch, they made me want to keep playing to collect more. I found that when the game screen was full of enemies, it was hard to avoid them all. I don't know if that's something you can change or if it's just part of the game's challenge. The controls were easy to understand and use. One thing that confused me was the pause and resume feature. I accidentally paused the game once and wasn't sure how to start again. Maybe you could add some on-screen instructions? All in all, I had a great time playing your game!
