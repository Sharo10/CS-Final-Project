# Final project Proposal

## Project Descirption

Upgrade my first project I did in CS30 to make it a bit more fun by adding some new features. 

## Needs to have list
- Freedom of controls (Interactive).
- Pause and resume buttons.
- Refresh or play again button.
- Collect flying down coins (2 ways to do so).
- Coins score display.
- Having rocks flying down that you have to avoid.
- Highest score display.
- Variety of different enemies (Types and sizes).


## Nice to have list
- Be able to display the game and be played on cell phones.
- Faster rocks and aliens falling down.
- More bullets for short time (Super power).
- The rocket's gas tank recharges by collecting "fuel" icons falling down on it and if that gas tank was done, the game stops.
