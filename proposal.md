# Final project Proposal

## Project Descirption

Upgrade my first project I did in CS30 to make it a bit more fun by adding some new features. 

## Needs to have list
- Freedom of controls (Interactive).
- Pause and resume buttons.
- Refresh or play again button.
- Collect flying down coins (2 ways to do so).
- Coins score display.
- Having rocks flying down that you have to avoid.
- Highest score display.
- Variety of different enemies (Types and sizes).


## Nice to have list
- Be able to display the game and be played on cell phones.
- Faster rocks and aliens falling down.
- More bullets for short time (Super power).
- The rocket's gas tank recharges by collecting "fuel" icons falling down on it and if that gas tank was done, the game stops. 


## Questions:

# What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
- If I had to create a project like this over again, I'd start small and add features over time. My game has always benefited from being divided into more manageable parts. A smart plan, I've discovered, can also cut down on development time significantly. I would use a lot of comments and a consistent coding approach to make my code easier to understand for both myself and other people. The most important thing is to test frequently and thoroughly; I wouldn't just look for problems, but also for game balance and user experience. I would constantly modify and improve my game because I knew that the first version was rarely the greatest. Asking for assistance when stuck and looking at similar games for ideas have always been beneficial. I would use my time better if I needed to do my nice to have. And finally, I must stress the value of taking breaks. When I move away from a subject, I frequently return to it with fresh eyes. Last but not least, I'd make an effort to enjoy the process because, in my experience, the journey may be just as significant as the final destination.



# Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
- Yes I did complete it all which was the main goal. I wish I could achieve some of the small goal which was the nice to have but I only achieved the mandatory.



## What was the hardest part of the project?
- Managing the collisions was certainly the most difficult part of this work. Due of the numerous complicated elements and nuances involved, this proved to be rather complex. A thorough understanding of the underlying physics was necessary to comprehend the mechanics of collisions in a two-dimensional universe. Furthermore, it was difficult to precisely detect accidents and respond to them. This component of the game required a high level of mathematical skill and featured significant computational complexity. This part's debugging was extremely challenging because even seemingly insignificant faults may have a big impact on how the game played, making it challenging to find and fix mistakes. A further layer of complexity was introduced by making sure the collision algorithm functioned correctly with the other game elements. Despite these difficulties, tackling the collision component gave me invaluable experience and a strong sense of satisfaction after I got it to function properly.



# Were there any problems you could not solve?
- No, I can not really think of any. It was overall challenging and took a lot of time to solve and debug it but since I completed all my needs to have list so there was no problem that was left unsolved.
