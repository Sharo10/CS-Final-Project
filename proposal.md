# Final project Proposal

## Project Descirption

Upgrade my first project I did in CS30 to make it more fun and a more professional game

## Needs to have list

- Be able to display the game and be played on cell phones.
- Menu, home, and pause and resume buttons.
- Collect flying down coins.
- Having rocks flying down that you have to avoid.
- Highest score display
- More enemies
- 

## Nice to have list

- Levels
- Faster rocks and aliens falling down.
- More bullets for short times (Super power).
- The rocket's gas tank recharges by collecting "fuel" icons falling down on it and if that gas tank was done, the game becomes over.
